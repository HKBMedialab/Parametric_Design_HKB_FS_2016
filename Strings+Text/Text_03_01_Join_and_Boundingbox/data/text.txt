Conditional Design
A manifesto for artists and designers.

Through the influence of the media and technology on our world, our lives are increasingly characterized by speed and constant change. 
We live in a dynamic, data-driven society that is continually sparking new forms of human interaction and social contexts. 
Instead of romanticizing the past, we want to adapt our way of working to coincide with these developments, and we want our work to reflect the here and now. 
We want to embrace the complexity of this landscape, deliver insight into it and show both its beauty and its shortcomings.
